# Project-Father-Time
This project is for a film development timer that I will use for a larger project in the future
One of my hobbies is shooting and developing film. This process requires me to set a timer to count down from a certain time depending on the chemical, keep track of the time because the film has to be agitated every 30 seconds, while making sure I'm not going over or under on time between inversions. I used my photo before but I would lose track of time or couldn't start the timer correctly because you have to wear gloves when dealing with C-41 chemicals. My solution was Father Time - a program that would track how many times the button was pressed and then would create a timer that was for the correct chemical I needed to use. From there, it begins a countdown and every time it reaches the inversion time, a LED would come on, telling me it was time to agitate the film. Then using a light sensor, it takes the current time, subtracts 30 seconds from it and makes that number the next inversion timer, looping until the time hits 0. Including in this Repo is the SolidWorks designs I created to custom fit the mini-breadboards I used for this project and the arduino code that can be used for both a Uno and Nano.
